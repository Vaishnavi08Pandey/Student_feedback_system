Project opensto a welcome page and after pressing enter button,
we come to the home page where we have options for
home,registration, login,about,contact which leads to respective pages.

In login, we have 2 modules such as Admin and Student.
Admin is the one who can see the feedbacks given by all students
In the login page,
we have given the option to login as admin and student...
You can select any one of them via buttons shown on login page.
Buttons for particular role will lead to the respective login pages.

Here since we have only one admin account,
so the admin email is "admin@gmail.com" and password is "admin".
"fb.sql" file already has create and insert queries.

In Registration,
Admin cannot register but there is a registration form for student.

In admin login: You can perform all admin actions such as login to the account,check all the feedbacks and log-out from the account.

If you entered the student user and password correctly in login page, then it will allow you to give feedback and you can also log-out from the account.
A Student can give feedback only once.

Feedback form has radio buttons where you can answer the questions by rating it from 1-5.

Create a database called "fb" and
"fb.sql" will create three tables according to commands mentioned in it.
